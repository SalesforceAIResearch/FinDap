# Demystifying Domain-adaptive Post-training for Financial LLMs

This is the codebase for [Demystifying Domain-adaptive Post-training for Financial LLMs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04961). 

The full datasets and scripts for all tasks will be released soon. 

### Ethical Considerations
This release is for research purposes only in support of an academic paper. Our datasets and code are not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. We strongly recommend users evaluate and address potential concerns related to accuracy, safety, and fairness before model deployment. We encourage users to consider the common limitations of AI, comply with applicable laws, and leverage best practices when selecting use cases, particularly for high-risk scenarios where errors or misuse could significantly impact peopleâ€™s lives, rights, or safety. For further guidance on use cases, refer to our [AUP](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/policies/ExternalFacing_Services_Policy.pdf) and [AI AUP](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/policies/ai-acceptable-use-policy.pdf).
